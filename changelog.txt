1.0.1:
	-Added the active_indicator[] element, which can draw a percent-based part of an image over another image, using a defined meta field.
	-Added support for the /give command
	-Added support for default furnaces
	-In Dynamic Lists, non-cubic nodes will now display in their proper form using the item_image[] element.

	-Fixed the hotbar's functionality on mobile. Tapping each slot now switches the wield index properly.
	-Fixed the "Press this or ESC to continue" window on mobile. Pressing the button now properly opens the inventory, rather than closing the form.
	-Added a workaround for mobile users being unable to place blocks. The Aux button can now place blocks as well.
	-To help with aiming the Aux button, a crosshair is now shown on mobile, as the regular one is permanently disabled by the Android Client.
	-Mobile's Aux key and extra crosshair can both be disabled in the settings.
	-Test items can now be disabled in the settings.
	-The hotbar HUD should now scale properly across different screen resolutions.
	-The game will no longer crash when you use an unknown item.
	-Right-clicking while holding a worn tool will no longer magically repair it.



1.0.2:
	-Dropped items now have velocity based on where the player is looking
	-Added support for default bookshelves and vessels shelves
	-Function lua_inv.change_involves_list now takes "inv" as its argument; it'll only check that inv to see if the change involves the given listname.
	-A few functions to override nodes from MTG to give them lua_inv support have become global. They can be reused for any similar nodes in other mods.
	-Dynamic Lists have a new element, "slot_bg", which will be drawn over any empty slot if its defined.
	-Added global callbacks for when a Dynamic Formspec is opened or closed.
	-Added native page support to Dynamic Formspecs.
	-Added "Fields" descriptions to the Dynamic Formspec API, as they were missing before.

	-Fixed some cases where the player's wielded item would be invisible.
	-Wielded item entities will no longer be statically saved. This could cause them to secretly accumulate over time.
	-Fixed various crashes caused by anything that would cause the game to try evaluating an itemstring's count.
	-Restored various on_step behaviors for item entities that were previously absent from lua_inv.
